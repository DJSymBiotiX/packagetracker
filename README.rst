This library tracks various packages (UPS, Fedex, and USPS)

Based on https://github.com/storborg/packagetrack by storborg,
but I saw some things that were a little weird, so I decided to
roll my own version that is hevily based on his code. Don't know if I'll
eventually try to turn it in to a merge request, or just make it a separate
package.

Installation
============

Simple as::

    $ pip install packagetracker

Or if you prefer, download the source and then::

    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install
