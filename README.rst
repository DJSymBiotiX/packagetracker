packagetracker - Track Packages
===============================

:Authors:

:Version: 0.0.1

This library tracks various packages (UPS, Fedex, and USPS)

Based on https://github.com/storborg/packagetrack by storborg,
but I saw some things that were a little weird, so I decided to
roll my own version that is heavily based on his code.

Don't know if I'll eventually try to turn it in to a merge request,
or just make it a separate package.

Installation
============

Download the source and then::

    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install
